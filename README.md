Maps of Needs

The Mission: A private, mobile-first space for somatic and psychological mapping. Know where you are, so you can find the way to where you want to be.

🔴 The Problem: The "Lost" Self
  Without a map, we are lost. Most people live in a state of chronic reactivity because they cannot identify their unmet needs. We confuse "dopamine cravings" with "authentic wants," leading to 
  exhaustion and self-betrayal.

🟢 The Solution: A Navigation System for Being
  Maps of Needs is a tool for Presence & Awareness. It allows users to create a "current state snapshot" by auditing their lives across 9 core parent domains and 27 sub-categories (children).

The User Journey
  The Pulse: Take 5-7 minutes to assess specific domains (e.g., "Autonomy & Freedom").
  - The Mapping: Rate statements on a 7-point scale to identify what is Integrated, Developing, or Emerging.
  - The Snapshot: View a prioritized ranking of need sub-categories based on your mapping.
  - The Direction: Choose specific areas of focus (e.g., "Dopamine Awareness") to move toward with intention.

🏗 Information Architecture
  The app is built on a [robust hierarchical framework of human needs](https://github.com/dudu5/maps-of-needs/blob/main/Full%20list%20(needs%20with%20children).txt):
  - 9 [Parent Domains](https://github.com/dudu5/maps-of-needs/blob/main/Parent%20definitions.txt): Presence, Cognitive Fulfillment, Rest, Identity, Social Connection, Safety, Autonomy, Health, and Purpose.
  - 27 [Child Sub-categories](https://github.com/dudu5/maps-of-needs/blob/main/Children%20definitions.txt): Including Detached Awareness, Inner Parts, Boundaries, and Absorbed Engagement (Flow).
  - The Transmit Function: Once a snapshot is created, the data can be "transmitted" to the Signal Forge for deeper structural analysis and reflection.

🛠 Initial Technical Goals
  - Local-First Vault: Data must be physically and cryptographically owned by the user. If we can see the data, the user cannot be radically honest.
  - Assessment Engine: A clean, 7-point scale UI that manages the weight and ranking of 27 sub-categories.
  - Snapshot Visualization: A visual representation of the map (ranking based on "Developing" vs "Integrated" status).

🛠 Principles
  - Zero Coercion: No manufactured urgency. Notifications or streaks are only used to support user-defined goals.
  - Sacred Privacy: Designed as a "self-reflection exercise," not a clinical or diagnostic tool.
  - Open Source: A public utility for the acceleration of human consciousness.
