Maps of Needs
Status: Concept / Seeking Technical Collaborator

🔴 The Problem
Humans are increasingly disconnected from their somatic and psychological needs. We operate on "autopilot," reacting to cultural programming rather than internal signals. Most tech exploits this for engagement; we need tech that provides a mirror and map - enabling individuals to navigate them. 

🟢 The Solution
A private, mobile-first space to gently map where your real needs are met, unmet, or asking for attention. Just you against your own honesty.

🛠 Principles
Local-First: Data is physically and cryptographically owned by the user. If the developer can see the data, the user cannot be radically honest.

Zero Coercion: Notifications, streaks, or UI patterns are only used to support user-defined goals. No "growth hacking," no manufactured urgency, and no engagement for the sake of engagement. The user is the master, the tool is the servant.

Organic Growth: Designed for individual clarity first.
